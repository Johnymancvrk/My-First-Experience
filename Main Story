I decided to create this repository to learn the basics of Git. Therefore, this project aims at facilitating me the opportunity to dive deep into coding and developing etc.
I will be trying to work by trying new things and functions.

First of all, I will be here directly on the website and then I will focus to manage this in the terminal.

1) I managed to download it from my GitHub for the first time. I suppose it is the right time to celebrate!
